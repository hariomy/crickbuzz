    That's what you call a collective team performance, isn't it? A lot of
    questions were raised on the team selection and leaving out Ravichandran
    Aswhin, but team India have answered them all with this fantastic win by
    gaining a 2-1 lead. Not many expected India to bounce back in such an
    emphatic manner after they were trailing by 99 runs at the halfway stage.
    But Rohit Sharma's brilliance and Shardul Thakur's contributions came to
    India's rescue. A match for the ages, indeed. Hope you guys enjoyed our
    coverage over the last five days. This is <strong>Nikhil</strong> signing
    off on behalf of
    <strong>Pradeep Krishnamurthy, Hariprasad Sadanandan, Mukesh</strong> and
    <strong>Siva</strong>. We'll be back with the coverage of the fifth Test
    on September 10. Don't forget to tune in for that. Goodbye and good night!

    <strong>Rohit Sharma, Player of the Match:</strong> I wanted to be on the
    field as much as I could. That hundred was special. We know how important
    was the second innings. Virat just mentioned the effort from the batsmen,
    and as a unit it was really important. It's my first overseas hundred.
    Really glad that I could get the team into an important position. The
    three-figure mark wasn't in my mind, we knew the pressure on the batting
    unit so we kept our heads down and batted the situation. Once we got the
    lead, we just wanted to put pressure on the bowlers. I try to contribute
    for the team, it's important for me. I know the importance of opening the
    innings. I am glad I could make it count. It's always important to embrace
    the challenge, it's not going to be easy. Back in Durham we had time off
    to look at our training and technique and after the World Test
    Championship final we had 20-25 days, that was a real game-changer. Looks
    (his injury) good at the moment, the message from the physio is that we
    got to assess every minute.

    <strong>Virat Kohli | Winning captain</strong> Well, I think the best
    thing about both the games has been the character the team has showed. We
    are not looking to survive in this game, we are here to win. Really proud
    of the character the team has showed. I said at Lord's as well, I am proud
    of the character shown by the team, this is amongst the top three bowling
    performances I have witnessed as India captain. It's quite relative what
    you call flat. The conditions were hot and we knew were in with an
    opportunity when Jadeja was bowling into the rough. The bowlers were good
    with the reverse swing today. We believed we could get all 10 wickets, we
    had the belief. As soon as the ball started reversing, Bumrah said give me
    the ball. He bowled that spell and swung the game in our favour with those
    two huge wickets. I think you pointed his performance. Rohit's innings was
    fantastic. What Shardul has done in this game stands out. His two fifties
    deflated the opposition. I think he batted well in both the innings. We
    never go towards analysis, statistics and numbers. We know what we need to
    focus on and we take a collective decision as a group. It's unfortunate
    (Ravi Shastri and co) they are not here. Everyone is happy with the win.
    It gives us more motivation to win the next Test. We have the belief, we
    are just looking forward to the opportunities. Whatever the noise's on the
    outset, it doesn't bother us. The fans have been amazing as well.

    <strong>Joe Root | Losing captain</strong> - It's frustrating, thought
    we'll get something from the game today, we had an opportunity of winning
    a Test match. The opening partnership was outstanding, credit to India,
    they got the ball to reverse. I thought Bumrah's spell was the real
    turning point of the game. From our side, we'll have to look at other
    areas where we missed opportunities, maybe we should have made more of an
    advantage with the first-innings lead and should have taken the chances
    that were offered. We always look to get better, he's (on Bumrah) a superb
    bowler and at times we need to be realistic and accept that he bowled
    really well, that was world-class bowling. Have to manage better if we're
    in a similar situation in the near future, especially our game against
    reverse swing. Whenever we lose a game, we can always look back at the
    toss, we can always think about a few things and the way it happened, but
    at the end of the day, we need to be ruthless, should have got more than a
    100-run lead. We needed that big hundreds, big partnerships - we need to
    play good cricket right around in Old Trafford, can't get complacent and
    get those big runs which sets up the game, which we did a week ago (in
    Headingley). You can pick out individuals, but need to work collectively
    as a batting group. Having got starts, you have to make those 20-30 runs
    count. Yesterday was a difficult day, some difficult chances (on Burns's
    drop at slip), it's very difficult at times, we need to know which ones to
    go to and keep taking our chances. It's not about the lack of effort, not
    about the lack of work, we just need to keep raising our slip catching
    standards. Woody is coming good, that's promising. It's been frustrating
    with the number of injuries that we have to contend with, but we can't get
    away with that. We'll have one big push going ahead at OT, injuries are
    something we need to manage, the guys have been excellent, they'll go out
    and play next week in Old Trafford and I'm proud of their effort.
